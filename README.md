# MERN Tracker

## Stacks  
This tracker is built using MongoDB, Express JS, React JS and Node JS. It has both front end and backend for the ease of building. 

## React  
The React web app will have different components such as creating exercises for user, editing exercises, deleting etc.

## Express  
The Express will handle the routing and communicate to MongoDB for a number of request such as get, post, delete.

There are also models for how the data is stored in MongoDB, which makes it easier to retrieve.


I will soon try to deploy the app and update the components asap.
